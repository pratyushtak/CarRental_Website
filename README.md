git clone https://github.com/pratyushtak/CarRental_Website.git

2️⃣ Navigate to the client folder

cd CarRental/client

3️⃣ Install dependencies

npm install

4️⃣ Run the development server

npm run dev

5️⃣ Open in browser

🎨 Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme variables for consistent styling across the application.
🔐 Environment Variables

Sensitive files such as .env are intentionally ignored from Git.

Create a .env file inside the client folder when needed.

Example:

VITE_API_URL=

A .env.example file can be used to document required variables.

    Modular component structure

    Centralized asset management

    Clean Git commit history

    Ignoring auto-generated and sensitive files (node_modules, .env, dist)
