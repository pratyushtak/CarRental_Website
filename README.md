# Car Rental Website – MERN Stack 🚗

A full-stack Car Rental Web Application built using the MERN stack. This project is being developed to gain hands-on experience with modern frontend tooling, scalable project architecture, and real-world full-stack development practices.

🚧 Project Status: Actively in development

## Project Overview

The Car Rental Website allows users to browse available cars, view car details, and make bookings through a clean and responsive user interface. The project follows industry-standard separation of concerns by maintaining separate frontend (client) and backend (server) layers.

This project is part of my learning journey toward becoming a Full Stack Developer and preparing for internships and placements.

## Tech Stack

Frontend:
- React (with Vite)
- Tailwind CSS (v4)
- React Router DOM
- JavaScript (ES6+)

Backend (In Progress):
- Node.js
- Express.js

Database (Planned):
- MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas)

Tools:
- Git & GitHub
- npm
- Vite
- Environment Variables (.env)

## Project Structure

├── client/ # React frontend
│ ├── src/

└── README.md

## Features

Current:
- Modern React setup using Vite
- Tailwind CSS styling with theme variables
- Client-side routing using React Router
- Organized asset management
- Clean and scalable folder structure

Planned:
- User authentication (Login / Signup)
- Browse and search cars
- Car booking system
- Booking history
- Admin dashboard
- Backend REST APIs
- MongoDB integration
- Deployment (Frontend and Backend)

## Getting Started (Frontend)

Navigate to the client folder

cd CarRental/client


Install dependencies

npm install


Run the development server

npm run dev


Open browser at:

http://localhost:5173

## Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first styling along with custom theme variables to maintain consistent design across the application.

## Environment Variables

Sensitive files such as .env are not committed to the repository. Create a .env file inside the client folder when required.

Example:
VITE_API_URL=

## Development Practices

- Modular component-based architecture
- Centralized asset management
- Clean Git commit history
- Ignoring auto-generated and sensitive files (node_modules, .env, dist)

## Learning Goals

- Understand full-stack application architecture
- Build scalable React applications
- Learn Tailwind CSS and modern styling practices
- Develop backend APIs using Node and Express
- Prepare real-world projects for placements
